<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I’m a woodworker who believes in quiet craft, slow process, and the kind of work that reveals itself layer by layer.  
Every piece I make begins with curiosity — grain, weight, resonance — and ends with something meant to be lived with, not just looked at.
</p>

<p>
My shop sits in the trees of Rainier, Washington, where I carve, shape, and finish each piece by hand.  
CNC carving, traditional joinery, and modern finishing techniques all meet here in a workflow that’s equal parts precision and intuition.
</p>

<p>
Windwood Woodworking is my way of sharing that process.  
If a piece speaks to you, or if you’re imagining something custom, I’m always open to conversation.

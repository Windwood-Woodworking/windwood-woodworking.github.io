# Windwood Woodworking

Welcome to my workshop.  
I build custom furniture, fine woodworking pieces, and CNC‑carved designs that blend traditional craft with modern tools.

---

## 🪵 What I Make
- Live‑edge tables and slabs
- Hand‑cut dovetail boxes
- CNC relief carvings
- Custom commissions
- Experimental joinery and one‑off builds

---

## 🌲 Philosophy
Wood tells the truth.  
Every board has a story — grain, tension, scars, and surprises.  
My job is to listen, shape, and reveal what’s already there.

## 🛠 Current Projects
- Updating my CNC workflow  
- Designing a new line of small‑batch boxes  
- Photographing past builds for the gallery
